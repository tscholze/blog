                            <h1>Rest in Peace JetBrains AppCode</h1>
                
                <p>Sad news for all Swift developers that where on the hunt for an alternative IDE since Xcode is for some of us getting worse and worse the last couple of years.</p>
<p>After now a decade, JetBrains decided to sunset their ObjectiveC / Swift IDE called &quot;AppCode&quot; with no other replacement, <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/appcode/2022/12/appcode-2022-3-release-and-end-of-sales-and-support/">according to their blog article</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we’ve had some growth in terms of adoption, we didn’t reach the market share we had hoped for. We believe that the time has come to sunset the product and focus our efforts in other directions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Fallback licenses</h3>
<p>JetBrains decided to uncouple all licenses from AppCode for currenlty active subscribers. The following statement declares what will happen to licenses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Normally when a fallback license is granted, the user receives a license for the version of the product that the user started their subscription with. But as a token of appreciation, we are doing things differently this time. Those who receive fallback licenses will get a license for the version that is available when their subscriptions end.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Sad to her but understandable</h3>
<p>All I can say now, is that I'm really sad but I understand JetBrains.The Ecosystem of Swift is still in a hurry with breaking changes here and compatibility problems there. The foundation of Xcode and AppCode seems to be the same Swift interpreter / highlighter, etc: SourceKit which is not always behaving well and creating some trouble for developers.</p>
<p>Let's hope that Xcode will become the best IDE for developers as it was a few years ago. What shall we do otherwise? We do not have any alternative now for mobile Swift development.</p>
