                            <h1>Kotlog passed its first milestone</h1>
                
                <p>As you may know, I wrote my own little static site generator called <a href="https://github.com/tscholze/kotlin-kotlog-cli">Kotlog</a> which stands for <em><strong>Kot</strong>lin B</em><em>log</em>*ging. The role the app should fill is to help me to stream line my content creation flow and first of all, get to know with the Kotlin programming language.</p>
<p>Kotlog is far away from being &quot;production ready&quot; or &quot;feature complete&quot; but I guess it has passed its first Milestone which is &quot;MVP&quot; (most viable product). That means I can use Kotlog to actually blog and there are no open &quot;must have features&quot;.</p>
<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kotlin is not that bad</li>
<li>JetBrains IntelliJ is still far better than Xcode in some regards</li>
<li>Do not over-think user flows</li>
<li>It is okay to build just something for yourself</li>
<li>It is okay, to start with a small set of features</li>
<li>There are friendly people out there who are willing to help beginners in Kotlin</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implemented features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markdown to Html post</li>
<li>Post to Social Media Image</li>
<li>Posts to index file</li>
<li>Posts to feed.json</li>
</ul>
<p>This all does not mean, that I have no ideas on how to improve Kotlog in the future. Believe me, there are a lot.</p>
<h3>Possible features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moving from Kotlin/html templates to Compose for Web or Kobweb</li>
<li>Adding interative CLI</li>
<li>Making it &quot;embedable&quot; in other apps</li>
<li>Adding &quot;add image&quot; support with optimizations reagarding the image file size</li>
<li>and many more ...</li>
</ul>
