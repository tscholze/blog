                            <h1>I submitted my JetBrains Space app!</h1>
                
                <p><a href="2022-10-04-my-expierences-with-the-jetbrains-space-app-tutorials.html">I mentioned in an earlier post</a> that I plan to participate in <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/contest/space/2022">JetBrains Space app contest</a>. Not because I’m a heavy user of their platform, rather more I needed some real use case to dig deeper into Kotlin.</p>
<p><img src="assets/jetbrains-space-intellij-license.png" alt="IntelliJ license" /></p>
<p>In a retrospective manner, the coding of the app was the simplest of all tasks. Space does not support hosted apps, yet. That means I had to “learn” how to dockerize <a href="https://github.com/tscholze/kotlin-spaces-app-onthisday">my app (On this Day)</a> which is a ktor server project, gets the required https into it and a little bit of ORM was also on my todo list – you must manage the auth tokens of all connected Space instance by yourself (I really hope this will change in future).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I sweared a lot and without the help of my friends I would not be able to write this post because I would rage-quitted the contest.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/bitspittle">David</a>, Phil and finally to Denis from JetBrains who had a lot of Slack mentions on Beginner’s questions.</p>
<p>I really hope that there are far more contributions to the contest than I saw – and more important, apps that helps the users and not just dumping facts of the day into the chat.</p>
<p>PS: Yes, I got a year-long subscription of IntelliJ Ultimate because of my app submission. Let’s see what happens next!</p>
