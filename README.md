# Personal blog
> A container for all static files that will be served at [tscholze.github.io/blog](https://tscholze.github.io/blog)

## Built using Kotlog
The blog is built using my spare time project called "Kotlog". You can have a look at [kotlog-ci](https://github.com/tscholze/kotlin-kotlog-cli) or [kotlog-template](https://github.com/tscholze/kotlin-kotlog-template) for further information.

Please be aware that Kotlog is not meant to be used in production or outside my tiny content creation bubble.
