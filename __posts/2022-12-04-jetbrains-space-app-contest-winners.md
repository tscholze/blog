Finally, JetBrains has [announced the winning apps](https://blog.jetbrains.com/space/2022/11/28/space-apps-contest-winners/) of their Space contest. I'm very execited to see such variaty of diffrent kind of apps devloped to the new all-in-one software development management platform!

Yes I also participated, but I knew that my app was not even "good enough" to get on the list of submitted apps - and without any doubts, JetBrains was right.

**Winnders**
1. [Checklist Buddy](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20330-checklist-buddy-for-space)
2. [Telescope](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20332-telescope)
3. [Get Emoji](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20251-getemoji)

Nevertheless, I really enjoyed digging into "the how of developing Space apps". Myself will re-join the game after JetBrains launched their "hosted app" feature and maybe their "all apps have to handle authentication by theirself" issue.

That said, JetBrains I will come back!
